-- we can use qqueryselector() and refer an id, class or tagname directly in the arugment inside it. All CSS rules apply to this argument including nth child.
-- callbacks are functions passed to another function as an argument.
-- JS is single threaded.
-- asynchronous, i.e., things do not happen at the same time.
-- if async is mentioned somewhere in the code, then that line may or may not execute before later lines.
-- taking control of an async is called a callback.
-- JS natively has only a single thread, hence only one call stack. 
--browsers have multiple threads by the name of web API.
-- setTimeout can be used to push any function to the web API and starts executing after the given timer.
-- returning from an async function is bad practice as it has uncertainity associated to it.
